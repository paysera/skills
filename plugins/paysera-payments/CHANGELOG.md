# Changelog

## 1.3.2 (2026-08-10)
- First public release on https://github.com/paysera/skills.
- Documented Personal Access Token creation against the public PAT API, replacing the
  previous pointer to an internal-only tool.

## 1.3.1 (2026-07-08)
- Fixed `list_transfers` in create-payment.py: the live dedup cross-check was querying the wrong direction — `debit_account_number` returns INCOMING transfers, so it never saw an executed OUTGOING duplicate. Now uses `credit_account_number` (accounting semantics: the payer is the credit side).
- Replaced the broken server-side cursor pagination (`_metadata.cursors.after` re-returns the same window then reports has_next=false, silently truncating) with `offset` pagination plus id-based dedupe, so a busy payer account is no longer capped at one page.
- SKILL.md: corrected the `GET /transfers` filter documentation to the verified direction semantics (credit = payer/outgoing, debit = beneficiary/incoming).

## 1.3.0 (2026-07-03)
- SEPA-zone detection, purpose-length trimming, exact-match buyer-name fallback, and extra
  non-blocking transfer states in create-payment.py.
